\section*{Mass Integrals}
Given an object covering area $A$, we can compute the mass by integrating its density:
$$
m = \int_A \rho(x, y) \dd{A}
$$
We can compute it's centre of mass by integrating over all points in the area weighted by the density, and then dividing by the total mass:
\begin{align*}
\bar{x} = &\int_A \frac{x \rho(x, y)}{m} \dd{A} = \frac{1}{m} \int_A x \rho(x, y) \dd{A}\\
\bar{y} = &\frac{1}{m} \int_A y \rho(x, y) \dd{A}
\end{align*}
Given a point around which the object is rotating, we can compute it's moment of inertia with
$$
I = \int_A \rho(x, y) ((x - x_r)^2 + (y - y_r)^2) \dd{A}
$$

Given a velocity through a surface and the density, we can compute the mass flow rate as
$$
\dot{m} = \int_A v(x, y) \rho(x, y) \dd{A}
$$

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The mass of a unit square (edge lengths of 1) centered at the origin with density $\rho(x, y) = x^2 + 2 x y + y^2 + 1$\\
    \newline
    \newline
    \newline
    \newline
  \item The centre of mass of a unit square centered at the origin with density $\rho(x, y) = x^2 + x - y^2 + 2$\\
    \newline
    \newline
    \newline
    \newline
  \item The centre of mass of a NACA airfoil with constant density $\rho$ and shape defined by
    $y_{top} = 5 [0.3 \sqrt{x} - 0.1 x - 0.4 x^2 + 0.3 x^3 - 0.1 x^4]$ and
    $y_{bottom} = -5 [0.3 \sqrt{x} - 0.1 x - 0.4 x^2 + 0.3 x^3 - 0.1 x^4]$ where $x$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.\\

\section*{Triple Integrals}
This is a generalization of double integrals.
Consider
$$
\int_V f(x, y, z) \dd{V} = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} \int_{y_0(x)}^{y_1(x)} \int_{z_0(x, y)}^{z_0(x, y)} f(x, y, z) \dz \dy \dx
$$
In the same manner as with double integrals, we can compute this as follows:
\begin{align*}
  g(x, y) = &\int_{z_0(x, y)}^{z_0(x, y)} f(x, y, z) \dz\\
  h(x) = &\int_{y_0(x)}^{y_1(x)} g(x, y) \dy\\
  \int_V f(x, y, z) \dd{V} = &\int_{x_0}^{x_1} h(x) \dx
\end{align*}
Note that Fubini's theorem still applies!
So long as any ordering these integrals results in a finite number, we can switch the order to get the same result!

Finally, all of the mass integrals also generalize to 3D (or really to any dimension),
i.e. the integrals all integrate over the volume rather than the area,
the moment of inertia integral adds in a $(z - z_r)^2$ term for the length from the rotation axis,
and $\bar{z}$ is computed in the same manner as $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$.
\subsection*{Problems}
Compute the following quantities
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The mass and centre of mass of a unit sphere centered at the origin with density $\rho(x, y, z) = x^2 + 3 z + 3$\\
    \newline
    \newline
\end{enumerate}
